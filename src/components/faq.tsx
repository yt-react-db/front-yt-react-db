                    Doing so using Google Sign In allows us to collect accurate information, and prevents bad actors from impersonating you. <br />

                    If you already gave us your permissions, you can go through the same process below to modify them.
                    Note that we keep an history of your previous permissions, so you can't falsely accuse someone to not respect your choices.
                    Note that it can take up to 24 hours for extension users to see the changes!
